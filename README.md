### `Student/Hustler/Developer/Craftsman`

Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Samir. I'm currently a student in Computer Science with hopes and dreams of making it as a Software Engineer. I'm passionate about learning new things in life and looking forward to improve my programming skills everyday.

  <summary><h2><u>** Samir's Coding Journey **</u></h2></summary>

  My coding journey started in 2021 when I decided to apply for the Computer Science program at Dawson College. I didn't know any basics and was just looking forward to learning a new skill, especially because of my friends having solid knowledge in the field of programming.

  I came to class each semester and learned a lot of important concepts, slowly falling in love with the process. I started exploring unfamiliar territories like Unity and even dipped into a bit of Blender. Creating a flappy bird-like game was a challenging task, but the sense of accomplishment was immense. 

  Even though it was a simple project, I was genuinely happy with the result and thrilled to navigate an unknown environment. Since that day, I've been hungry for knowledge, always excited to delve into new concepts, languages, frameworks, and more.

  Looking ahead, I'm eager to continue my journey and explore new horizons in the vast world of coding.
